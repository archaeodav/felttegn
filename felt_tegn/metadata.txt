about=This plugin is intended to enable archaeological museums in Denmark to use Qgis to process survey data from excavations. It takes GNSS and total station data as coded text files and generates the appropriate geometries and attributes based on feature codes. It is intended to mirror the functionality of MapDigi for MapInfo, currently used by many of the museums.
